MPs that pass all PI thresholds are in green and those that do not are presented in red.  MPs that are not available for use with current data are listed in black and the lacking data are listed in the last column to the right. For PI122a, P/F refers to passing or failing the HCR requirement (see below HCR and Tools).\n\nMPs colored green are feasible and pass all of the performance indicator thresholds. MPs colored red are feasible but do not pass performance indicator thresholds. MPs colored black are not feasible. The column 'Reason not feasible'  explains the reason for this and can be due to data restrictions (D) controlled by data question 1, and/or management restrictions (M) controled by management question 1\" \n\n```{r Ptab,echo=F,warning=F,error=F,message=F}\n\n Ptab1<-Ptab(params$MSEobj,params$MSEobj_FB,Eyr=10,rnd=0)\n Ptab_formatted(Ptab1)\n\n```\n\n<br>\n\n\n# Performance Trade-Offs \n\nLong term yield (LTY) vs probability biomass is greater than half BMSY in the first 10 years (PI.1.1.1a)\n\n```{r P1_LTY,echo=F,warning=F,error=F,message=F}\nP1_LTY_plot(params$MSEobj)\n\n```\n\nLong term yield (LTY) vs probability biomass is greater than half BMSY in years 11-50 (PI.1.2.1a)\n\n```{r P2_LTY,echo=F,warning=F,error=F,message=F}\nP2_LTY_plot(params$MSEobj)\n\n```\n\n<br>\n\n\n# B/BMSY and relative yield projection plots\n\nFor each MP a 50 year projection is presented showing the possible range of values for spawning biomass relative to MSY levels (B/BMSY) and yield relative to FMSY fishing (Relative yield, Rel. Yd.). The colored region represents the 10th and 90th percentiles, the white line is the median trend and lines for two simulations are included to show the typical degree of variability within a simulation. \n\n\n```{r pencil,echo=F,warning=F,error=F,message=F,results='asis',fig.width=12, fig.height=7}\n \n nMPs<-length(params$MSEobj@MPs)\n panelsperplot<-12\n nplots<-ceiling(nMPs/panelsperplot)\n plots<-split(1:nMPs, ceiling(seq_along(1:nMPs)/panelsperplot))\n \n for(i in 1:length(plots)){\n   MSEobj2<-Sub(params$MSEobj,MPs=params$MSEobj@MPs[unlist(plots[i])])\n   Pplot3(MSEobj2)\n }\n\n \n\n```\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n# Harvest Control Rules and Tools: PI.1.2.2.a\n\nWhen the 'Calculate' button was pressed, two MSEs were carried out. The first undertook projections for 50 years. The second only projected a few years subject to a range of starting stock levels and with the simulation of perfect data. The motivation behind the second MSE run is to understand whether the MPs have a 'Harvest Control Rule' property that throttles fishing mortality if biomass is below BMSY (ie a positive relationship between fishing mortality rate and biomass when simulations were under BMSY levels). To examine this a linear model was fitted to the fishing rates (obtained by each MP) given a range of biomass levels. Those MPs that could achieve a significant positive trend are highlighted in green. \n\n```{r HCR,echo=F,warning=F,error=F,message=F,fig.width=13, fig.height=4.5}\n\n nMPs<-length(params$MSEobj@MPs)\n panelsperplot<-12\n nplots<-ceiling(nMPs/panelsperplot)\n plots<-split(1:nMPs, ceiling(seq_along(1:nMPs)/panelsperplot))\n \n for(i in 1:length(plots)){\n   \n   MSEobj_FB2<-Sub(params$MSEobj_FB,MPs=params$MSEobj_FB@MPs[unlist(plots[i])])\n   HCRplot(MSEobj_FB2)\n }\n\n\n\n```\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n# Cost of Current Uncertainties\n\nWhen answering questions in the Fishery, Management and Data panels above, you may have included more uncertainty in your answers to some questions. The Cost of Current Uncertainties analysis examines which questions are associated with the greatest veriability in long-term yield. To do this the range of values specified in each question is divided into subranges and the variance in yield is determined across among these sub-ranges. This provides a measure of which uncertainties are the largest determinants of future long term yield (ie which questions are the most important in determining performance as they were answered). \n\n\n```{r CCU1,echo=F,warning=F,error=F,message=F,include=F}\nnMPs<-length(params$MSEobj@MPs)\npanelsperplot<-6\nnplots<-ceiling(nMPs/panelsperplot)\nplots<-split(1:nMPs, ceiling(seq_along(1:nMPs)/panelsperplot))\nVOIout<-new('list')\nfor(i in 1:length(plots)){\n  MSEobj2<-Sub(params$MSEobj,MPs=params$MSEobj@MPs[unlist(plots[i])])\n  VOIout[[i]]<-getVOI(MSEobj2)#,ncomp=17,nbins=6)[[1]]\n}\n\n```\n\n\n\n```{r CCU2,echo=F,warning=F,error=F,message=F,fig.width=15, fig.height=10}\n\nfor(i in 1:length(plots)){\n  MSEobj2<-Sub(params$MSEobj,MPs=params$MSEobj@MPs[unlist(plots[i])])\n  CCU_plot(VOIout[[i]],MSEobj2)\n}\n\n```\n\n\n\n# Version Notes\n\nThe package is subject to ongoing testing.
