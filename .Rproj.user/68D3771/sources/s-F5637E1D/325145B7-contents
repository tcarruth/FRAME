# Value of information analysis

Arguably one of the most important uses of operating models is quantifying the value of various sources of information. 

Value of information (VOI) analyses can be used to prioritize data collection and steer research and discussion towards those subject areas most critical in determining management success. 

There are three distinct types of value of information analysis: the value of better data, the value of additional data and the cost of current uncertainties.

## Value of better data

The value of better data considers more precise and less biased data arising from better experimental design, increased sampling intensity or more sophisticated data filtering and processing techniques. Analysis of better data can be achieved by quantifying the marginal benefit of increasing the precision or accuracy of the various data types (e.g. a relative abundance index, annual catches, catch composition) and establishing those that most strongly affect the yields (or any metric of utility) derived from a particular management system.

A simple way to do this in our analyses is to related the bias in a particular observation type to a performance metric. Here we evaluate the correlation between long-term yield from a pair of delay-different MPs with bias in catch observation error (where over reporting are bias values greater than 1, under reporting are bias values less than 1): 


## Value of additional data

Value of additional data examines the potential benefit of other management procedures that are possible given the collection of new types of data.

## Cost of current uncertainties

Post-hoc analysis of MSE results often reveals gradients in performance with respect to particular parameters of the operating model; most often: natural mortality rate, steepness of the stock recruitment curve, stock depletion, the size selectivity of fishing, annual increases in fishing efficiency and spatial targeting.

This analysis doesn't identify specific data to be collected or improved but simply highlights where operating model uncertainty may lead to selection of MPs that are worse than other MPs over sub-ranges of model parameters.  

This problem can be rephrased as the yield lost due to not using an MP that may perform better but cannot be selected due to risks associated with parameter uncertainty.
